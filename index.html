<h1>About me at 17 Years old</h1>
<p class="aboutme17">
  Elon Musk a Hero to Earth & Soon to the entire Universe
Lets Make this a life long thing:
Hi My name is Ashan jeevanathan, Currently 17 years old, I started learning how to code when I was around 10 years old, 
i learnt through many udemy courses and from people online 
and i did create websites and also how to setup websites and all the backend stuff but eventually i did have to prioritse my studies and i quit codding.
However one day, I was just browsing through the alpha-successful people in the world, and many of them have plain simple websites which was quite interesting,
Then I was thinking, I might as well create my personal portfolio website now and keep updating it every now and then so the websites a long history of my life,
Its currently Wednesday 15th March 2023, 21:16:09, and I have setup the foundations to my site.
This is the only about me you will see, I will do one every single year just to see how i change throughout the Years until death. (if i can be arsed for that long)
But the whole point is to read all my about mes so I dont include all the irrelevant information over the years.
Theres alaways been a thing about About mes in the world od web developement and I see it an interesting prospect.
Almost all websites has an About Me, but doesnt that about me change? do you not change as a person overtime?
<br>
This is my current about me: 
my English writing is awful, I really wish there was grammarly for visual studio code, but thinking about it I could just write it on notion or word then just paste it onto VSC.
Hello People of the world, My name is Ashan Jeevanathan, 17 years old, my birthday is on the 2nd Decemember 2005, I think I was born around 10-11pm, who cares though.
I was Born in Switzerland, lived there for like 2-3 years and my parents decided to go to United Kingdom, (once)Great Britian, England, Leicester, LE4 ###, 
I am Currently just doing my A levels: Maths, Chemistry, Biology & Physics.
I have many ambitions & Aspirations for the future, Theres many things I want to do for the world & hummanity, but its really difficult when im the person that 
just gets Interested in almost everything. Rockets, Cars, Space, Astronomy, Medtech, Biotech, Medtech, Global Healthcare, Medicine.
Whilst Elon musk is doing almost all the things ive mentioned on the list to the Absolute maximum, Theres one thing he hasnt really touched, and Healthcare is one of the only sectors 
where its very randomized in terms of research and advancements, overall there has been advancements within healthcare of course, but its a very collective globally and its a thing that many researchers 
work on together and boom they create sometihng revolutionary, but there has been many individual Achievements within Healthcare. <br> But Spaace, yh cool, NASA, SpaceX Individual organisations.
Im going very off topic here, but I hope for my about mes to improve over time and become more straight to the point, but theres not really much point of editing and removing cringe things I may say cuz who cares, we're all 
going to die soon anyways, and one thing that doesnt die is the interent (i hope) so yh, this will remain here forever.
