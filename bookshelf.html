                    <p><strong>Quotes:</strong> <br> 1. "ideas are worth nothing unless they are executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.” <br> 2. “Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what's not working. ” <br> 3. “Set up your business like you don't need the money, and it'll likely come your way."
                         <br>
                        4. "No matter which goal you choose, there will be lots of people telling you you're wrong. 
                        Just pay close attention to what excites you and what drains you. Pay close attention to when you're being the real you and when you're trying to impress an invisible jury. ”
